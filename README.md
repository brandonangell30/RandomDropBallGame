# Randomized Ball-dropping Game

This is a client-server arcade-style game developed as a final project for CS 35201. 
Players control a bucket that must catch balls dropping from random points in the sky. 
The game demonstrates basic real-time networking between a client and server using Python and Pygame.

  - Sends input data to the server
  - Receives updated game state from the server

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.3
- Pygame library
